    Incremental Delay allows the delay to be increased by a specific amount
    of time <code>TimeUnit</code> between reach recurring retry. The delay 
    starts out at the min and then increases by the increment each round 
    after until it reaches the max, then the max for the remaining rounds.
    An example of the <code>incremental(increment, min, max, unit)</code> 
    usage in a pipeline retry step looks like:

    <code>retry(count: 4, 
        delay: incremental(increment: 60, min: 10, max: 50000, unit: 'SECONDS'), 
        useRetryDelay: true) {
            error("oops")
        }
    </code>
