    Exponential Delay allows the delay between retries to exponentially grow
    larger for issues that cannot be immediately fixed. The delay starts out 
    at the min and then increases 2^x * 1 <code>TimeUnit</code> each round 
    after until it reaches the max, then the max for the remaining rounds.
    An example of the <code>exponential(multiplier, min, max, unit)</code> 
    usage in a pipeline retry step looks like:

    <code>retry(count: 4, 
        delay: exponential(multiplier: 2, min: 10, max: 50000, unit: 'SECONDS'), 
        useRetryDelay: true) {
            error("oops")
        }
    </code>
