    Random Delay allows for jitter between retries to help in cases where there 
    might be contention with external forces. A random number will be chosen
    between the min and max values and will be used as the time in 
    <code>TimeUnit</code> delay. An example of the usage of 
    <code>random(min, max, unit) </code>in a 
    pipeline retry step looks like:

    
    <code>retry(count: 4, delay: 
        random(max: 60, min: 4, unit: 'SECONDS'), 
        useRetryDelay: true) {
            error("oops")
        }
    </code>
