<div>
    Saves a set of files for use later in the same build, generally on another node/workspace.
    Stashed files are not otherwise available and are generally discarded at the end of the build.
    <strong>Note</strong> that the <code>stash</code> and <code>unstash</code> steps are designed for use with small files.
    For large data transfers, use the External Workspace Manager plugin,
    or use an external repository manager such as Nexus or Artifactory.
    This is because stashed files are archived in a compressed TAR, and with large files this demands considerable on-master
    resources, particularly CPU time.
    There's not a hard stash size limit, but between 5-100 MB you should probably consider alternatives.
