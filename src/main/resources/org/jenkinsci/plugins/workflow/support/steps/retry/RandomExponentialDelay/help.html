    Random Exponential Delay starts out at the 2^0 {@TimeUnit} and then 
    increases 2^x * 1 {@TimeUnit} each recurring failure. The x is 
    incremented after each round giving you larger delay until it reaches
    the max delay. At that point a random number between one and max in
    <code>TimeUnit</code> is generated for the delay foreach remaining retry.
    An example of the <code>randomExponential(multiplier, max, unit)</code> 
    usage in a pipeline retry step looks like:

    <code>retry(count: 4,  
        delay: randomExponential(max: 50000, multiplier: 2, unit: 'SECONDS'), 
        useRetryDelay: true) {
            error("oops")
        }
    </code>
