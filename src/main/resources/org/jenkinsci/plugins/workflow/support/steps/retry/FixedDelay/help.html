    Fixed Delay is a Retry Delay option that allows the you to configure the Retry
    so that there is a fixed amount of time <code>TimeUnit</code>before the system 
    tries to execute an action in which an exception was thrown in the previous 
    execution. An example of the usage of <code>fixed(delay,unit) </code>in a 
    pipeline retry step looks like:
    
    <code>retry(count: 4, delay: fixed(time: 2, unit: 'SECONDS'), useRetryDelay: true) {
            error("oops")
        }
    </code>
