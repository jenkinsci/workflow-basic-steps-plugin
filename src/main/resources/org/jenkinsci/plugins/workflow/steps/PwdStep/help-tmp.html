<div>
    If selected, return a temporary directory associated with the current directory path rather than the directory path itself.
    The return value is different for each current directory. No two directories share the same temporary directory.
    This is an appropriate place to put temporary files which should not clutter a source checkout;
    local repositories or caches; etc. Defaults to false.
