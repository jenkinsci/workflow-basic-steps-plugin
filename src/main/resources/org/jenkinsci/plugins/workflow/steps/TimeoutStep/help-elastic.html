<p>
Decide timeout limit from the duration of the timeout block in the last successful build.
Requires <code>ID</code>.
Timeout is used for the default value when elastic timeout limit cannot be calculated
(e.g., there's no previous successful builds).
</p>
<p>
Specify the rate for timeout limit to the last duration.
E.g. specifying 2.0 makes timeout limit twice of the last duration.
