    If true, certain types of exceptions that are used to interrupt the flow of
    execution for Pipelines will be caught and handled by the step. If false,
    those types of exceptions will be caught and immediately rethrown. Examples
    of these types of exceptions include those thrown when a build is manually
    aborted through the UI and those thrown by the <code>timeout</code> step.
