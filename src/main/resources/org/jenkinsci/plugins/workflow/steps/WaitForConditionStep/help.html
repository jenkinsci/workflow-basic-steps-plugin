<div>
    Runs its body repeatedly until it returns <code>true</code>.
    If it returns <code>false</code>, waits a while and tries again.
    (Subsequent failures will slow down the delay between attempts up to a maximum of 15 seconds.)
    There is no limit to the number of retries,
    but if the body throws an error that is thrown up immediately.
</div>

<p>Example:
<pre><code>
    waitUntil(quiet: true) {
     // some block
    }
</code></pre>
</p>
